        <h1> This is a blog about nothing</h1>
        <h2>What is nothing?</h2>
            <p>
            Nothing is the absence of something, but isn't the absence of 
            something still <strong> something? </strong>The absence of water
            is not nothing; it's air or some other particles right?
            </p>
        <h2>Where can you find nothing?</h2>
            <p> 
            Nothing can be found everywhere, even where there is a lot 
            of something.  You just have to be able to see it.  It's like 
            what the mystics call silence.  From <em>silence </em>comes 
            everything.
            </p>
        <h1>And now here is a list of nothingness</h1>
            <p>
                I'll start by saying that a list of nothingness can never be 
                exhausted of course but here is some:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>space</li>
                <li>time</li>
                <li>humans</li>
            </ul>

            <p>and now here is a list of nothingness in the order in which
                it is nothing:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>humans</li>
                <li>time</li>
                <li>space</li>
            </ol>
